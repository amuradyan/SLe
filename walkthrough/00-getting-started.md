# Square one

Welcome!

To get started we need to set up our tools first.

If you have already forked and cloned this repo - good, otherwise go ahead and do that now.

Once you have the repo in your machine, open it with VS code. It will suggest a number of extensions - install them. Make sure deno runs and the syntax highlighting works. Run the following command in the terminal at the root of the repo:

    deno test --watch

The line above should run successfully.

Congratulations! You are now ready to start working on the project.

Go on, move [step one] and start on the task.

    git checkout 01-making-a-sound

[step one]: ./01-making-a-sound.md
