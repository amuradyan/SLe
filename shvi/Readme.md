# Shvi ðŸªˆ

Shvi is a tool to write music. The notation is inspired by Lisp, and the language is designed to be simple and extensible.

Below is the [passage from _Still Dre_](fixtures/still-dre.shvi)

```lisp
(sequence
  (silence 500)

  ;  Twin-            kle,          twin-         kle,
  (tone C4 500) (tone C4 500) (tone G4 500) (tone G4 500)
  ;  Lit-             tle           star
  (tone A4 500) (tone A4 500) (tone G4 1000)
  ;  How              I             won-          der
  (tone F4 500) (tone F4 500) (tone E4 500) (tone E4 500)
  ;  what             you           are
  (tone D4 500) (tone D4 500) (tone C4 1000)

  (silence 500)

  ;  Up               a-            bove          the
  (tone G4 500) (tone G4 500) (tone F4 500) (tone F4 500)
  ;  world            so            high
  (tone E4 500) (tone E4 500) (tone D4 1000)
  ;  Like             a-            dia-          mond
  (tone G4 500) (tone G4 500) (tone F4 500) (tone F4 500)
  ;  in               the           sky
  (tone E4 500) (tone E4 500) (tone D4 1000)

  (silence 500)

  ;  Twin-            kle,          twin-         kle,
  (tone C4 500) (tone C4 500) (tone G4 500) (tone G4 500)
  ;  Lit-             tle           star
  (tone A4 500) (tone A4 500) (tone G4 1000)
  ;  How              I             won-          der
  (tone F4 500) (tone F4 500) (tone E4 500) (tone E4 500)
  ;  what             you           are
  (tone D4 500) (tone D4 500) (tone C4 1000))
```

and the "da da da DUMMMM" from [Beethovens' 5th](fixtures/beethovens-5th.shvi)

```lisp
(sequence
    (silence 1000)

    (parallel (tone G3 300) (tone Eb3 300))   ; da
    (parallel (tone G3 300) (tone Eb3 300))   ; da
    (parallel (tone G3 300) (tone Eb3 300))   ; da
    (parallel (tone Eb3 2000) (tone G2 2000)) ; DUMMM

    (silence 600)

    (parallel (tone F3 300) (tone B2 300))    ; da
    (parallel (tone F3 300) (tone B2 300))    ; da
    (parallel (tone F3 300) (tone B2 300))    ; da
    (parallel (tone D3 2000) (tone G2 2000))) ; DUMMM
```

Shvi defines sounds as a combination of a pitch and duration with `tone` and combines the sounds with `sequence` and `parallel`.

## Using Shvi

To use it, you can pass it a `*.shvi` file and it will generate a `.wav` file with the sound and play it

```bash
./shvi.sh fixtures/still-dre.shvi
```

 or pass it an output file and it will generate a the wave file.

```bash
./shvi.sh fixtures/still-dre.shvi still-dre.wav
```

**NOTE:** Currently, the script assumes you have `aplay` installed. If you don't, either install it or change the [script](./shvi) to use a different player.

## Structure

It consists of the following components:

* Tokenizer â€“ breaks input strings into s-expression tokens
* Evaluator â€“ recursively processes expressions
* Environment â€“ manages bindings and lexical scopes
* Sintez â€“ a JavaScript engine responsible for generating sound waves and writing audio files
