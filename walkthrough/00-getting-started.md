# Square one

Welcome!

In this repo we'll build a build a tool to write and play music step by step. Each step of the exercise is a git branch that provides the key tests to that step and the code scaffolding that should be implemented. Once the tests pass, you can move to the next branch and so on. The branch names start with the two-digit step index, followed by the functionality description, e.g. `00-getting-started`, `01-making-a-sound`, etc.

To get started we need to set up our tools first. If you have already forked and cloned this repo - good, otherwise go ahead and do that now.

Once you have the repo in your machine, open it with VS code. It will suggest a number of extensions - install them. Make sure deno runs and the syntax highlighting works. Run the following command in the terminal at the root of the repo:

    deno test --watch --allow-all

The line above should run successfully. Keep it running in the background, as it will watch for changes in the code and run the tests automatically as you move through the steps.

Congratulations! You are now ready to start working on the project.

Go on, move [step one] and start on the task.

    git checkout 01-making-a-sound

[step one]: ./01-making-a-sound.md
